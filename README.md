# Receipt Processor API

This project implements a web service that processes receipts to calculate and store points based on specific rules. The application provides two main API endpoints:

1. `/receipts/process`: Accepts a JSON receipt, calculates points, and returns a unique ID.
2. `/receipts/{id}/points`: Retrieves the points for a receipt by its ID.

## Features
- Process receipts and calculate points based on predefined rules.
- Retrieve points for processed receipts using a unique ID.
- Data is stored in-memory, making the application stateless across restarts.
- Implemented using Node.js and Express.js.
